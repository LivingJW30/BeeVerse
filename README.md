# BeeVerse
Cyber challenge for Hack@UCF general body meeting. Ping @Jack.py on Discord with the flag. 

Flag format: hack@ucf{*flag-name*}

## Background
The CEO of bWAPP never made it back from his vacation (RIP the Biggest Bee). The head of IT has been cleaning up the former CEO's computer and found an executable program that he can't make sense of. However, something feels important about it (It's labeled IMPORTANT). The IT manager has tasked you, the sole cyber intern, to find out what's so important about this “important” program. Do you have what it takes?

Note: Windows isnt going to like you running a random .exe and will label it as a Trojan but trust there is NO MALWARE. I am not that skilled! To run this executable on Windows do the following:

+Click on and run the exe > click on defender pop-up > select "allow on device" in drop down window. 

## Guided questions
1. What is an executable and what are the differences on Windows vs. Linux systems?
2. Is there a way to see the source code of an application?
3. How can a string from the source code be beneficial to taking a certain path in an application?

Note: You only need to submit the flag but hopefully these questions can help you work your way through the challenge.

## Resources
- For Windows OS use the IMPORTANT file with the .exe extension
- For Linux OS use the IMPORTANT file without the extension

## Write up
*will be updated at challenge end*
