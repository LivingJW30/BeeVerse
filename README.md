# BeeVerse
Cyber challenge for Hack@UCF general body meeting. Ping @Jack.py on Discord with the flag. 

Flag format: hack@ucf{*flag-name*}

## Background
The CEO of bWAPP never made it back from his vacation (RIP the Biggest Bee). The head of IT has been cleaning up the former CEO's computer and found an executable program that he can't make sense of. However, something feels important about it (It's labeled IMPORTANT). The IT manager has tasked you, the sole cyber intern, to find out what's so important about this “important” program. Do you have what it takes?


## Guided questions
1. What is an executable and what are the differnces on Windows vs. Linux systems?
2. Is there a way to see the source code of an application?
3. How can a string in source code be beneficial to taking a certain path in an application?

Note: You only need to submit the flag but hopefully these questions can help you work your way through the challenge.
